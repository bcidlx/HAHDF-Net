HAHDF-Net: A Heterogeneous Dual-Stream Convolutional Fusion Network with Hemispheric Asymmetry for EEG Emotion Recognition

<p align="center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

In recent years, research on electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition leveraging hemispheric asymmetry has achieved remarkable progress. However, existing methods face two key limitations: on one hand, the use of standard convolution operations for feature extraction makes it difficult to efficiently capture hemispheric differential texture features with specific orientations and scales; on the other hand, relying on simple concatenation or linear combination strategies to integrate heterogeneous features makes it difficult for the model to fully exploit the deep complementary information between the dual-stream features, thereby limiting both model performance and interpretability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hemispheric asymmetry heterogeneous dual-stream fusion network (HAHDF-Net). Specifically, based on the International 10--20 system, a global spatial topology matrix (GSTM) and a hemispheric difference topology matrix (HDTM) are constructed. Subsequently, a frequency-decoupled 3D convolution module is employed to model the global spatial patterns of each frequency band, and a learnable Gabor-like 3D convolution module mimicking the receptive field properties of the visual cortex is used to capture hemispheric-difference texture features with specific orientations and scales. Furthermore, inspired by the prefrontal--limbic system emotion regulation theory in neuroscience, an attention-based adaptive gated fusion mechanism is proposed, which uses global contextual information to dynamically modulate hemispheric-difference information, enabling deep fusion consistent with biological priors. Extensive experiments are conducted on the DEAP, SEED, SEED-IV, and HBUED datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.
